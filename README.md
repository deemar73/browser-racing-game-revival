Legacy browser-based racing game seeking collaborators for modernization.

# Browser Racing Game Revival

## What This Is
This is a legacy browser-based racing management game that was originally built in 2009 and I bought it in 2019 as a systems-heavy project focused on cars, parts, stats, and progression. The game already includes functioning dealership, engine, inventory, and pricing systems, but the underlying architecture and UI are outdated. I’m looking to modernize and clean up the codebase rather than start over from scratch. This repository exists to find collaborators interested in helping revive and reshape the project.

## What Already Exists
- Core gameplay systems
- Car dealership & inventory
- Engine & parts systems
- Stats, pricing, progression logic

## Why This Needs Help
The game was built over a long period of time using patterns and assumptions that made sense then, but don’t hold up well now. The codebase is tightly coupled, hard to extend, and not friendly to iteration or UI improvements. While the core systems work, making meaningful changes or adding new features has become increasingly difficult. I’m looking for help refactoring, reorganizing, and modernizing the structure so the project can evolve again.
